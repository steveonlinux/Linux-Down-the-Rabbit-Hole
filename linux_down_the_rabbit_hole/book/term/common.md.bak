# Common Misconceptions

## Conflation of Terms
The meaning of the terms terminal, terminal emulator, command line, and shell are often conflated. The uses and definitions of these kinds of programs are very much interlinked. However, they are distinct things and it is important that you understand their differences. If you don't understand these differences then you will lack a fundamental understanding of how you are communicating with your operating system and computer. Furthermore, misunderstandings of these softwares will lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding when communicating with others on certain topics. 

## Terminals
*Terminals* have existed in a conceptual form since the 1940s. Essentially, terminals are hardware devices that allow users to input data to and transcribe data from a computing system. A *teletypewriter* *teletype*, or *tty* is one of the most prolific types of terminals. These devices resembled typewriters and would print the computer output on paper. Computer terminals advanced over the decades. Eventually some utilized screens and had their own built in data processing capabiltiies aside from the computer. For many, many years, terminals were the de facto way to interact with any computer. Terminals can still be found today in modern operating systems, including Linux. However, they technically aren't true terminals since they aren't hardware devices. On Linux, terminals are virtualized using *device files*. Device files are coveered in the later chapter: [File Structure, File Systems, & Permissions]().
