# Live Environments & Installers

When you successfully boot into your new environment, you will be greeted by desktop new (assuming the distro you chose comes with desktop environment installed).This is the *live environment*. A live environment is a fully functional Linux environment and can be used as such. You can practically do anything you would do on an actual Linux install in a live environment, however in the vast majority of cases nothing you do to the environment will persist. Most live environments are simply a way to "test-drive" the distro before installation.

Beyond everything else that is installed there, an installer will be available that will allow you to permanently install your Linux distro. There are number of installers that are commonly used by distros, and it is up to the distro developers to chose which they would like for their users, or to develop their own. Installers commonly used by distributions are:
* Calamares (distro agnostic)
* Ubiquity (Ubuntu)
* Anaconda (Fedora)
* YaST (SUSE)

Modern day Linux installers are fairly intuitive and straight forward. They are guided, offer explanations within their interfaces, and usually provide usable defaults. Each has slight differences from others but they all share the same basic functions. Each will allow the user to:
* Configure Locale Settings
* Create Users and Passwords
* Select Installation Drives
* Partition Drives & Configure Filesystems
* Install Bootloader
* Select Software for Pre-Installation

If you are installing Linux on a single drive machine where you do not intend to dual boot or on a virtual machine, most default options should be fine for the puposes of this book. If you intend to dual boot, you may have to partition the drives yourself. However, some installers support the detection of other operating systems. Drive partition will be discussined in the following sections.
